Nimble Manual
======

Introduction
------

<small>*"Nimble is a toolkit for doing AI on human biomechanics (physically simulated realistic human bodies), written in C++ for speed, but with nice Python bindings. It focuses on studying real physical human bodies.Nimble started life as a general purpose differentiable physics engine, as a fork of the (not differentiable) DART physics engine."*</small>

As the documentation writen by the authors said, Nimble can complete numerous tasks on physical simulation with AI.

**However, if you have to use this physics engine just for simulation except for researching on [Addbiomechanics Dataset](https://addbiomechanics.org/), I would rather suggest you reconsidering another physics engine** since the documentation hasn't been updated for a long time, and any emails and issues sent to the authors will not be replied.

Fundamental functions
------

Firstly, you have to setup your simulation world.

```
import nimblephysics as nimble
world = nimble.simulation.World()
world.setGravity([0, -9.81, 0])
world.setTimeStep(0.001)
```

These codes will create a simulation world with gravity and simulation timestep, which is vital in calculating the kinematics and dynamics.

Let's add a box! The type of object is called "Skeleton" in nimble.
```
box = nimble.dynamics.Skeleton()
boxJoint, boxBody = box.createTranslationalJoint2DAndBodyNodePair()
boxShape = boxBody.createShapeNode(nimble.dynamics.BoxShape([.1, .1, .1]))
boxVisual = boxShape.createVisualAspect()
boxVisual.setColor([0.5, 0.5, 0.5])
```


Moreover, you need a [pre-defined urdf](https://github.com/keenon/nimblephysics/blob/master/data/sdf/atlas/ground.urdf) if you want to add ground to the simulation world.
```
ground: nimble.dynamics.Skeleton = world.loadSkeleton("your path to ground.urdf,here is an example: /hdd/junxuanl/Molign/data/ground.urdf")
```

After defining the box, Let's visualize the simulation! The state is combined with positions and velocities. (state=[positions,velocities])

```
initialState = torch.tensor([0, -0.70, 2, 0])
//There are two dimesions of freedom for the box, so the shape of positions and velocities are both (2,1)
action = torch.zeros((world.getActionSize()))
//The shape of action is (2,1)
state = initialState
states = []

for _ in range(300):
    state = nimble.timestep(world, state, action)
    states.append(state)

gui = nimble.NimbleGUI(world)
gui.serve(8080) # host the GUI on localhost:8080
gui.loopStates(states) # tells the GUI to animate our list of states
gui.blockWhileServing() # block here so we don't exit the program
```
![non-collision](../../../../../files/nimble/non-collision.gif#pic_center)

It's strange right? The box just crossed the ground. If you want to add collision to both of them, just use createCollisionAspect()

```
boxShape.createCollisionAspect()

floorBody: nimble.dynamics.BodyNode = ground.getBodyNode(0)
floorBody.getShapeNode(0).createCollisionAspect()
```

![collision](../../../../../files/nimble/collision.gif#pic_center)

Remember that the timestep of simulation can't be too small!(for example, set it to 0.01s) Otherwise the box will still cross the ground.

![fail-collision](../../../../../files/nimble/fail-collision.gif#pic_center)

To allow for the interaction and transfer of forces between objects (collisions), setRestitutionCoeff() is needed.

```
boxBody.setRestitutionCoeff(0.8)
floorBody.setRestitutionCoeff(0.8)
```

![restitution](../../../../../files/nimble/restitution.gif#pic_center)

There are [some cases](https://github.com/keenon/nimblephysics/tree/master/python/new_examples) in github repo, which are not written in the documentation.
